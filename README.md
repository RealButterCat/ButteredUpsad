# ButteredUpsad

An interactive website RPG with maximal player freedom. This project transforms a seemingly normal website into a game environment where players can interact with any element, break objects, solve puzzles, and create their own adventures.

## Features

- Website-integrated gameplay with hidden game layers
- Universal interaction system (click, drag, attack any element)
- Physics and collision detection
- Persistent world state (changes remain after page refresh)
- Player inventory and progression system
- NPCs and quest system
- Website reactions to gameplay events

## Technologies Used

- HTML5/CSS3 for structure and styling
- JavaScript (ES6+) for interactivity
- Canvas API for game rendering
- Local Storage for saving game state

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Explore the website, then click the "Start Game" button to activate the game layer
4. Use WASD or arrow keys to move
5. Click on objects to interact with them

## Development Roadmap

This project is being developed in phases:
1. Core Setup - Basic structure and movement
2. Interaction Systems - Physics, collision, and universal interaction
3. RPG Mechanics - Inventory, quests, and NPCs
4. Polish & Expansion - Sound, animations, and possible multiplayer
